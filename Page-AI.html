        <h3>What is <span> Artificial Intelligence (AI)? </span></h3>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence
          processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific
          applications of AI include expert systems, natural language
          processing, speech recognition and machine vision. As the hype around
          AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their
          products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is
          simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI
          requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing
          and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming
          language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia
          have features popular with AI developers.
