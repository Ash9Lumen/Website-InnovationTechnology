        <h3>What Is a <span> Drone? </span></h3>
        <p>
          Drones, sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
          carry out tasks that range from the mundane to the ultra-dangerous.
          These robot-like aircrafts can be found rescuing avalanche victims as
          well as dropping off groceries at your doorstep — and almost
          everywhere in between. Originally developed for the military and
          aerospace industries, drones have found their way into the mainstream
          because of the enhanced levels of safety and efficiency they bring.
          These robotic UAVs operate without a pilot on board and with different
          levels of autonomy.
