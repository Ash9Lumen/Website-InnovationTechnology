        <h3>What is <span> Technology Innovation? </span></h3>
        <p style="color: white;">
          Technological innovation is the economic function through which new
          technologies are introduced into production and consumption. It
          entails recognizing new technological possibilities, organizing the
          human and financial resources needed to transform them into useful
          products and processes, and sustaining the requisite activities.
          Innovators are usually unable to capture all of the incremental
          economic benefits their contributions yield, which can lead to
          incentive failures characterized as the appropriability problem.
          Innovative activities also entail high risks of technological failure
          and (especially) the misperception of market demands.
