        <h3>What is <span> Virtual Reality? </span></h3>
        <p>
          Virtual reality is a simulated 3D environment that enables users to
          explore and interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that
          approximates reality, as it is perceived through the users' senses.
          The environment is created with computer hardware and software,
          although users might also need to wear devices such as helmets or
          goggles to interact with the environment. The more deeply users can
          immerse themselves in a VR environment -- and block out their physical
          surroundings -- the more they are able to suspend their belief and
          accept it as real, even if it is fantastical in nature.
